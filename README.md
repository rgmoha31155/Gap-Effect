# Gap-Effect
Model intra-plot gap effect to predict true yield of a hybrid when there are gaps in the plot.
Majority of our field trial plots (~60% of plots in North America Corn trials) have gaps inside them due to loss of plants caused by environmental, operational, and other reasons.
Understanding how the plants in a plot respond to the gaps is important in terms of generating reliable yield data for product decisions.
Data from both microplot trial and a 2022 POC yield trial indicate that there is, on an average, 15%-20% yield compensation from intra-plot gaps, which is significantly higher than the current perception in our scientific community and literature.
Data from the 2022 POC trial also demonstrated how theÂ observed yield from a plot is an outcome of the dynamics of two opposing phenomena; one, the yield loss due to the missing plants and, two, the yield compensation of the neighboring plants due to the gaps.
